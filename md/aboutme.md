# About Me

Hi, I’m Stephen Warren, a retired entrepreneur, Crypto enthusiast, and founder of Hashman Enterprises. My journey into Cryptocurrency began over a decade ago with an unexpected introduction: online poker.

Back then, I was playing low stakes penny poker as a hobby, but keeping my account funded with traditional payment methods was a constant struggle. That’s when I first heard about Bitcoin. Curious and determined, I researched this “internet money,” bought my first Bitcoin through Coinbase.com (back when they offered only a small handful of Cryptocurrencies), and used it to fund my poker account. Little did I know, this small step would spark a lifelong passion.

Later, when I returned to reload my poker account, I discovered something incredible—I had significantly more money in my Bitcoin wallet than when I started. Bitcoin’s value had risen during that time, and I realized I was sitting on an opportunity far bigger than poker. From that moment on, I was hooked.

It was just then that I took my interest to the next level by cofounding Hashman Mining LLC, where we mined Bitcoin and Ethereum using custom-built rigs and ASIC miners. It was an exciting time, and for a while, we were quite successful. However, like many in the Crypto space, I learned some hard lessons along the way. After falling victim to a scam, Hashman Mining LLC was dissolved, and I was forced to reimagine my path forward.

Despite the challenges, I’ve remained passionate about Cryptocurrency and its potential to shape the future of finance. Today, I’ve launched Hashman Enterprises, a brand dedicated to exploring new opportunities while sharing my journey and lessons with others.

## **The $100K Era: A New Dawn for Cryptocurrency**
Bitcoin has reached an unprecedented milestone, surpassing $100,000 in value—a price analysts believe is here to stay. This historic achievement marks the beginning of a stable and promising future for digital finance, fueled by:
1. **Pro-Crypto Policies**: Under President Donald Trump’s leadership, the U.S. has taken bold steps to legitimize and integrate Cryptocurrency into its financial systems.
   - The **U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve**, encompassing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major assets, has provided a foundation for growth and stability.
   - Sweeping **regulatory shifts** have made the U.S. a global hub for blockchain innovation and investment.
2. **Investor Confidence**: With Bitcoin stabilizing above $100,000, the Crypto market is witnessing renewed optimism and record-breaking growth.
